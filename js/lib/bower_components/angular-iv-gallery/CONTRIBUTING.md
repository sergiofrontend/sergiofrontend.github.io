# Contributing
Thanks for your interest to contribute. Please see the tips below.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bower install` in the project root directory
3. Run `npm install` in the project root directory
4. To test when developing, you can use `gulp watch` which will watch the file changes listed in the config of gulp task watch and test it every time the changes are saved. If you have new files, you probably need to add the new files into the config.
5. To build the project into a minified version in `dist` folder, you can use `gulp build` or just `gulp` to do it.
6. Before you create a pull request, please make sure you write some test for your code. If necessary, please update the README file to reflect your work.
